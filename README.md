## Application Architecture

This application is built using a vanilla React frontend and a GraphQL API. The frontend is powered by the Apollo Client, which allows for efficient data fetching and management. The reason for doing it without any UI frameworks is to showcase the power of Apollo Client and its ability to handle complex data fetching scenarios, as well as to provide a more streamlined development experience without the need for additional libraries that may not be necessary for a simple task management application, since it is a SPA (Single-Page Application) and not a full-fledged web application.

### The application architecture is as follows:
